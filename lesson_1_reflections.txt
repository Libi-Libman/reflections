How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I could find the misspelling in the file 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I could check for mustakes and then correct them with the older version, more then that,
if I see somthing that I don't understand why I choose to do in a certain way I can
go back and trace my thinking path.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

manually - pros:you choose when to save, you can save at logical points and add notes.
cons: You might forgot to save for a while and lose some progress.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git is build for programmers, an programmers, a lot of times we have a certain file that
connect to some other file and they need to be saved together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log will show me all the commits with their names, and diff will let me compare between two specific commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I can alweys go back to an earlier version with chackout so nothing get lost

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

programming
