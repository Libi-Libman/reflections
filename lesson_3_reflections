sWhen would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I want to share my work with others and when I want it to be reachable from anywhere 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because Git can't always know what I do want to pull and what not, I might just want to pull something when it's ready
    and not having many files that are not the end product.
    Maybe even there are files that are only for other people that I work with and I don't need them on my computer.
